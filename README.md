# Solar-Panel-Dirt-Sorter
A project addressing the problem of knowing when to clean solar panels. It trains an SVM algorithm on several images to identify whether a solar panel is dirty and in need of cleaning or not. Currently predicts with an accuracy of 98% via SVM. Aiming to improve and add realtime functionality to this in order to deploy this via drones.
